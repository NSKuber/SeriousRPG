# SeriousRPG

'SeriousRPG.lua' is the main code which handles player's experience/levels/upgrades, while 'UniqueMonsters.lua' handles elite monsters' affixes and effects.
The mod also contains a menu script but I didn't include it because it is rather similar to that of the NSKuber's Resource Manager menu.
